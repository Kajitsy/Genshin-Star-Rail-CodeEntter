# How it works?
Install [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/genshin-star-rail-codeenter/) from the Firefox add-on store.

I have no idea how to publish extensions to the Chrome Store

Chromium/Firefox: just login to your account.

From 2.1.0 the function of automatic collection of daily rewards is available!
Check your in-game mail and claim your rewards!
