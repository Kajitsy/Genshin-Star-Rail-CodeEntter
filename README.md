# Genshin-Star-Rail-CodeEntter
Genshin/Star Rail CodeEntter is a Firefox/Chromium browser extension that allows you to automatically enter codes for the Genshin Impact/Honkai Star Rail game and receive rewards.

# How it works?
Install [extension](Not yet) from the Firefox add-on store.
I have no idea how to publish extensions to the Chrome Store, but for now, use these extensions for FireFox:
[HSR CodeEnter](addons.mozilla.org/addon/hsr-codeenter/)
[Genshin CodeEnter](addons.mozilla.org/addon/genshin-codeenter/)
(so far, this version of the extension is not available in stores... and there is no firefox version in general, use my previous ones)

Chromium Version: you will have to log in to your account through the extension, at least for me
FireFox Version: coming soon.

Click on the extension icon, enter the promotional code, you can also share it with friends, a site with a promotional offer will open in a pop-up window where you can select the account region and enter the promotional code in one button.

Check your in-game mail and claim your rewards!
# I don't know why I decided to combine them?
I just sometimes had to enter promo codes both ways, and with my number of extensions, it was problematic to find the right one...
